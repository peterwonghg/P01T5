# SCRUM MINUTES - AGILE Application

Project01 is a solo attempt, in order to demonstrate the collaboration component of the project virtual avatars - MICHAEL and LUCIFER are created as two collaborators assigned to Project01.

This project is based on the Scrum methodologies within the AGILE project management framework.

The main feature of the Scrum methodologies as outlined in Sam Ngu's 230424 Server-Side APIs Day 2 Module Zoom session are:
```
1. BRAINSTORM
2. SHORTLIST
3. BACKLOG
4. EPIC Assignment
5. DAILY STANDUP
6. END OF WEEK
7. END OF SPRINT
```

The Scrum minutes will be journalled in a chronological order to demonstrate the development process of the Project01 for tracking purposes
